# ByteForge-Umbrella
Social Network similar to Discord and other platforms.

This umbrella repository tracks the evolution of my **ByteForge** project — a social networking site similar to Discord, Slack, Guilded, etc...

It includes both **frontend-only** and **full-stack** versions, implemented using different frameworks and backends to reflect my growing skill set.
